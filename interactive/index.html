        J.R.R. Tolkien (born January 3, 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa—died
        September 2, 1973, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England) was an English
        writer and scholar who achieved fame with his children’s book The Hobbit
        (1937) and his richly inventive epic fantasy The Lord of the Rings
        (1954–55). At age four Tolkien, with his mother and younger brother,
        settled near Birmingham, England, after his father, a bank manager, died
        in South Africa. In 1900 his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, a
        faith her elder son also practiced devoutly. On her death in 1904, her
        boys became wards of a Catholic priest. Four years later Tolkien fell in
        love with another orphan, Edith Bratt, who would inspire his fictional
        character Lúthien Tinúviel. His guardian, however, disapproved, and not
        until his 21st birthday could Tolkien ask Edith to marry him. In the
        meantime, he attended King Edward’s School in Birmingham and Exeter
        College, Oxford (B.A., 1915; M.A., 1919). During World War I he saw
        action in the Somme. After the Armistice he was briefly on the staff of
        The Oxford English Dictionary (then called The New English Dictionary).
        For most of his adult life, he taught English language and literature,
        specializing in Old and Middle English, at the Universities of Leeds
        (1920–25) and Oxford (1925–59). Often busy with academic duties and also
        acting as an examiner for other universities, he produced few but
        influential scholarly publications, notably a standard edition of Sir
        Gawain and the Green Knight (1925; with E.V. Gordon) and a landmark
        lecture on Beowulf (Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, 1936).
        Tolkien had completed a translation of Beowulf in 1926, and it was
        posthumously published, along with classroom lectures he had given on
        the subject, some of his notes, and an original short story inspired by
        the legend, as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary (2014). He also
        published an edition of the Ancrene Wisse (1962).

        In private, Tolkien amused himself by writing an elaborate series of
        fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful, set in a world of his own
        creation. He made this “legendarium,” which eventually became The
        Silmarillion, partly to provide a setting in which “Elvish” languages he
        had invented could exist. But his tales of Arda and Middle-earth also
        grew from a desire to tell stories, influenced by a love of myths and
        legends. To entertain his four children, he devised lighter fare, lively
        and often humorous. The longest and most important of those stories,
        begun about 1930, was The Hobbit, a coming-of-age fantasy about a
        comfort-loving “hobbit” (a smaller relative of Man) who joins a quest
        for a dragon’s treasure. In 1937 The Hobbit was published, with pictures
        by the author (an accomplished amateur artist), and was so popular that
        its publisher asked for a sequel. The result, 17 years later, was
        Tolkien’s masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, a modern version of the
        heroic epic. A few elements from The Hobbit were carried over, in
        particular a magic ring, now revealed to be the One Ring, which must be
        destroyed before it can be used by the terrible Dark Lord, Sauron, to
        rule the world. But The Lord of the Rings is also an extension of
        Tolkien’s Silmarillion tales, which gave the new book a “history” in
        which Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and Men were already established.
        <br /><br />
        Contrary to statements often made by critics, The Lord of the Rings was
        not written specifically for children, nor is it a trilogy, though it is
        often published in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two
        Towers, and The Return of the King. It was divided originally because of
        its bulk and to reduce the risk to its publisher should it fail to sell.
        In fact it proved immensely popular. On its publication in paperback in
        the United States in 1965, it attained cult status on college campuses.
        Although some critics disparage it, several polls since 1996 have named
        The Lord of the Rings the best book of the 20th century, and its success
        made it possible for other authors to thrive by writing fantasy fiction.
        It had sold more than 50 million copies in some 30 languages by the turn
        of the 21st century. A film version of The Lord of the Rings by New
        Zealand director Peter Jackson, released in three installments in
        2001–03, achieved worldwide critical and financial success. Jackson then
        adapted The Hobbit as a trilogy comprising the films An Unexpected
        Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the
        Five Armies (2014). In 2004 the text of The Lord of the Rings was
        carefully corrected for a 50th-anniversary edition.
        <br /><br />
        Several shorter works by Tolkien appeared during his lifetime. These
        included a mock-medieval story, Farmer Giles of Ham (1949); The
        Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book (1962),
        poetry related to The Lord of the Rings; Tree and Leaf (1964), with the
        seminal lecture “On Fairy-Stories” and the tale “Leaf by Niggle”; and
        the fantasy Smith of Wootton Major (1967). Tolkien in his old age failed
        to complete The Silmarillion, the “prequel” to The Lord of the Rings,
        and left it to his youngest son, Christopher, to edit and publish
        (1977). Subsequent study of his father’s papers led Christopher to
        produce Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth (1980); The History
        of Middle-earth, 12 vol. (1983–96), which traces the writing of the
        legendarium, including The Lord of the Rings, through its various
        stages; and The Children of Húrin (Narn I Chin Hurin: The Tale of the
        Children of Hurin), published in 2007, one of the three “Great Tales” of
        The Silmarillion in longer form. Christopher also edited Beren and
        Lúthien (2017), which centres on the romance between a man and an elf
        and was inspired by Tolkien’s relationship with his wife, and The Fall
        of Gondolín (2018), the third of the “Great Tales,” about an Elvish city
        resisting the reign of a dark lord; both books contain various
        retellings of the stories, including the original versions that were
        written in 1917.
        <br /><br />Among other posthumous works by Tolkien are The Father
        Christmas Letters (1976; also published as Letters from Father
        Christmas), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien (1981), the children’s stories
        Mr. Bliss (1982) and Roverandom (1998), and The Legend of Sigurd and
        Gudrún (2009), two narrative poems drawn from northern legend and
        written in the style of the Poetic Edda. The Fall of Arthur (2013) is an
        unfinished verse exploration of Arthurian legend inspired by the Middle
        English Morte Arthure.
